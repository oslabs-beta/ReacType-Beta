 * Redux State Dependencies:
 * - `styleSlice`: The style settings from the Redux store which determine the CSS styles applied to the creation panel.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} A React element that renders the creation panel containing the component and HTML panels,
 *                        configured according to the theme specified in the props.
